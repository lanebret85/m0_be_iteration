# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
Any time you're working with an array with mutliple elements and you need to print or manipulate some or all of those elements, an each method will allow you to achieve that without coding every single action you want to take with that array. It's a lot more efficient to write one code block that does several actions for you.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I still need more practice with the terminology. It's coming along, and some of the earlier terminology from Mod 0 that felt unfamiliar at first has now sunk in much better with more practice, so I expect the same to happen with that of arrays, each loops, methods, etc. That being said, I'm getting into the habit of talking out my process aloud as I'm working, which I also think will speed up the learning.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
 It helped that I had a little bit of background knowledge in iteration in python, but I also think experimentation was really helpful. Once I felt like I had a good grasp of the basic concepts, it was great to play with my code a little outside the guidelines of the instructions to see if I understood what I was doing as much as I felt like I did. That way, it's either reassuring, or I learn what I didn't understand as well as I thought I did as I go.
